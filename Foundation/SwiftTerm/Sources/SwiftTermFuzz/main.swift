//  This file has two purposes, one it provides the entry point for the
//  fuzzer, and second, it runs through a battery of tests from the fuzzer
//  they are run separately.
//
//  Sadly, there does not seem a way of making this file serve two purposes
//  at once without editing it every time.   If compiled for fuzzing, no
//  calls from the toplevel are allowed, but to exercise, you want that call.
